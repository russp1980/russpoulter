overview: 
    - "During my time at BT Consumer I worked accross numerious multidisciplinary squads on the EE's digital products. This involved working across the whole user centred design process from initial problem framing, research, ideation and running workshops to user testing, stakeholder management, wire-framing and detailed user interface design. I worked on both the web site and mobile app during time at EE"
    - "As well as my day to day design work I was also invloved on a number of working groups and initiatives including ee.co.uk site simplification, EE Design System, EE design language, Figma best practices as well as mentoring and advising more junour members of the design team."

overview: 
    - 'Cloudtrainer is a web based e-learning  platform. Since I started working with them Iâ€™ve overhauled the end-to-end user experience of the product. This has involved producing an in depth UX audit of the existing product, researching the user base, creating user personas, developing user flows & journey mapping, producing wire frames and interactive prototypes and designing a new user interface.'
